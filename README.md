# Simplified Wavefront Algorithm
Simplified implementation of the [wavefront expansion algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_expansion_algorithm) in the context of a "catch game". The agent (represented by the character "C") tries, by using the information obtained from the algorithm, to catch his enemy (represented by the character "&"), who moves randomly. To compile the program, use the command "make all". To run it, use the command "make run".
